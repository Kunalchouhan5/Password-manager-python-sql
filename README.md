## Setup  

### Step 1: Clone Project and Project Files   

```git clone https://github.com/Kunalchouhan5/Password-manager-python-sql.git```

### Step 2: Generate a Master Password Hash

There are "two factors". of authentiation included within the program. There are two options. You have to make sure the second_FA_location variable is either commented out or has a string inside the main.py program. If you do want to have a second factor of authentication, then you need to include hash the master_password_hash and the second_FA.  

Enter the master password hash inside the master_password_hash variable inside the master_password.py program.  

### Step 3: Connect to Docker Container  
Enter in correct username, database name, and password inside the db_connect.py file.  

### Step 4: Run Main.py  
Run main.py with all files inside the same directory.

```main.py [ARGUMENT] [OPTIONS}```  

Example to add Password: ```main.py -a https://cybercademy.org gcollins```  

Enter the one of the following paramters:
